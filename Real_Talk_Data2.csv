About 2 months after they broke up, him and 2 of my other friends had a sleepover at my house. We all went out to a park nearby around midnight and sat on an awning above the pond, listening to music and goofing off. He put his arms around me, and it made me feel amazing. Later that night, we all fell asleep in my living room, him and I cuddling on the couch; The next morning, he helped me make breakfast, and asked me to be his girlfriend. I was so excited, and he made me so happy. Not only had he been a great friend, but he had been proving himself to be great boyfriend material ever since he found out I liked him. He helped me cook, listened to my babbling, did the dishes without being asked despite being a guest in my house. We had the same sense of humor, liked doing a lot of the same things. After we became official, he would hang out at my house a lot and we would do homework together, watch TV, etc. ; One day, we sat in my room, organizing my bookshelf, and he asked me to tell him about all my favorite books. He found a picture of a dog that I used as a bookmark, and asked about her- my first best canine friend. Another time, he took the last aussie bite (a weird oatmeal snack that tastes awesome) and ran off, and I chased him all over my apartment complex until we collapsed on the ground laughing. I had an asthma attack, and he ran to my house to get my inhaler, then insisted on carrying me back home because I ""still sounded wheezy""; Once, I said I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, and he went into panic mode and started looking through my kitchen for something to feed me. I remember sitting in his lap when a friend of my brother's made some inappropriate comment and he held me closer and told the person to screw off. There were other times like this, where someone was being innappropriate, and he knew it bothered me so he would put the person in their place; A kid once straight up asked if we had had sex yet, and I made some flippant comment about making him wait, and he looked me straight in the eyes and told me that he was fine with waiting as long as I needed. Eventually though, my anxiety got in the way and I ruined everything. I pushed away the guy that looked at me like I was his whole world, that called me beautiful despite the cringey haircut I had, who loved my affinity for animals, and who never, ever pushed me to do anything I wasn't comfortable with; He ended up breaking up with me after 3 months, because I was so awful to him sometimes. I had thought I could be better for him than his previous girlfriend, but I didn't know how bad my anxiety would get, that I would hurt him too. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that I was okay with the break up. Now, two years later, I can't seem to get him off my mind. But I don't want to hurt him again- I can't  try to drag him back in. It would be selfish.",http://teenshealth.org/en/teens/anxiety.html?ref=search&WT.ac=msh-t-dtop-en-search-clk,http://teenshealth.org/EN/images/headers/T-anxietyDisorder-enHD-AR1.jpg,Anxiety Disorders,TeensHealth,

During that week he was so nice and constantly sending me good morning texts and saying all these very nice compliments. Then all of the sudden one day he stopped sending good morning texts and was kind of distant. I knew something was wrong and so I confronted him about it; He told me that our schedules were too busy to have a relationship with me (we go to different schools). I was sad but also okay because I was not sure if I liked him yet; For 2 weeks without talking to him I was sad and I realized that I did like him, but it was too late. Then after 2 weeks of not talking I saw him at a sporting event between our schools and we said hello but that was it. Later that night he texted me saying that he felt like things ended bad and that he wanted to start talking again. I was unsure if I could trust him. I didn’t know if he was going to leave again, but I told him I felt the same way; Then we talked every since then and recently talked about making it official and date. Then one day my friend told me that this girl that previously commented on his picture told my friend that she and him were talking. I asked him about it and he denied it saying that they talked only as friends. This brought up a conversation about dating and what we were; He told me that he wanted to date me but he was still really confused and not 100% sure what he wanted. I told him to think about it over the weekend. On the weekend, we hung out and talked about us and decided that we wanted to date.; Then about 3 days after this he was distant again so I texted him. And sure enough he was basically lying the whole time and used me. He told me that he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship with me because he was still caught up on another girl; Meanwhile. This girl that he was caught up on was the reason we stoped talking the first time for 2 weeks. During those 2 weeks he had a thing with this other girl but then she dumped him... so he came crawling back to me.

I am a guy and when puberty hit and I started developing as a female I knew something was very wrong. ; Estrogen is the female hormone and it is what causes chest development and curves, thinner body hair, a higher voice, a round face, mood swings, and for most people a very low sex drive. Testosterone is the male hormone and it’s what causes thick facial and body hair, a prominent jawline, a deep voice, easily agitated, and a high sex drive.; Puberty and estrogen hit me like a truck. I had developed a large chest and a fragile frame. My periods kept me bed ridden from the pain they caused and it was never shorter than 10 days for me. It made me seclude myself and hide from social situations. You could say I was depressed but I see it as distressed.; I came out as transgender after pushing myself to be feminine and to “work through it.” A bit after that I started testosterone.
